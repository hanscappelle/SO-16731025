            This sample shows how a TextView is not centered in its parent if using
            layout_centerInParent running on API level 19 while it is running on an
            API level 21 device. You can even see the effect using the preview in
            Android Studio if you toggling API level there. For this "bug" to show
            TextView has to be wrapped within a ScrollView. Use the action menu to
            toggle between options.
